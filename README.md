# Linear Regression Model

What does this repository have?
- Random linear data generator
- Implementation of a Linear Regression Model
- Fit data, predict and plot the results

This model was based on the following equations:

$$ \text{Slope: } \hat{\beta}_1=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\bar{X})^2} $$

$$ \text{Intercept: } \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1X $$

$$ \text{Linear equation: } \hat{Y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1X_i $$

$$ \text{Residual sum of squares: } \sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\hat{Y}_i)^2 $$
